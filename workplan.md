# Hypercode — Work Plan

Status snapshot and task backlog for the Hypercode language (`.hc`) and its
cascade sheets (`.hcs`). Companion to the [RFC](RFC/Hypercode.md) and the
[syntax spec](EBNF/Hypercode_Syntax.md).

**Legend:** ✅ done · 🔜 in progress / next · ⬜ planned · 🅿️ deferred · ❓ decision needed

## Guiding invariants

- `.hc` stays deliberately **simpler than YAML**: structure / intent only, no values.
- Values and context live in `.hcs`; swapping `.hcs` must **never** require touching
  `.hc` (white-label).
- Source of truth = `.hc` + `.hcs`. Any YAML/JSON output is a **generated artifact**,
  not a source.
- The **resolved graph** is the contract between Hypercode and any consumer.
  Consumers (Ontology, …) depend on Hypercode, never the reverse.
- Target-specific compilation (DomainOntologyPackage, Terraform, …) is
  **consumer-owned**, downstream of the resolved graph.
- Rules are **executable specifications** (SpecificationCore): grammar,
  validation and cascade resolution are composable `Specification` /
  `DecisionSpec` objects — the 0AL house style.
- **Values cascade; contracts accumulate and narrow** (RFC §9.4). A more
  specific selector may override a value, never weaken an inherited contract —
  safety is not subject to specificity.

## Open decisions

- ✅ **Adopt SpecificationCore** (`github.com/SoundBlaster/SpecificationCore`).
  Decided: grammar, validation and cascade resolution are expressed as composable
  `Specification` / `DecisionSpec` objects. Zero *external* deps still holds —
  SpecificationCore is 0AL's own foundation.
- ✅ **Extract a shared grammar-core**, but **build it here in Hypercode first**,
  then refactor Hyperprompt and Ontology onto it (see M6).
- ✅ **D1 — `.hcs` lexical syntax.** Hand-rolled minimal subset for now; Yams is
  **not** pulled in until we actually consume real YAML input.
- ❓ **D2 — Resolution semantics form.** The SpecificationCore specs *are* the
  executable rules. Open: how much extra prose / fixtures (and, later, Lean) to
  layer on top, and when.

## M0 — Spec foundation
- [x] HC-001 `.hc` BNF syntax spec, incl. INDENT/DEDENT block rule — `EBNF/Hypercode_Syntax.md` *(PR #5, open)*
- [x] HC-002 ANTLR reference grammar + `.hc` test suite — `EBNF/`
- [x] HC-003 CI running the grammar tests — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` *(PR #5, open)*
- [x] HC-004 Merge PR #5 into `main` (merged by maintainer)

## M1 — Swift reference implementation: parsing ✅
- [x] HC-010 `.hc` lexer with indent/dedent (off-side rule) — `Sources/Hypercode/Lexer.swift`
- [x] HC-011 `.hc` recursive-descent parser → `Command` AST — `Sources/Hypercode/Parser.swift`
- [x] HC-012 `hypercode` CLI: parse + print tree — `Sources/HypercodeCLI/`
- [x] HC-013 Lexer/parser tests ported from fixtures (15 green) — `Tests/`
- [x] HC-014 Adopt SpecificationCore + seed the `Specifications/` layer (`IdentifierSpec`) — `Sources/Hypercode/Specifications/`

## M2 — Cascade resolution ✅ core (on SpecificationCore)
- [x] HC-020 Resolution semantics — `EBNF/Hypercode_Resolution.md` (operational semantics narrating the executable specs; conformance = `Examples` + `CascadeResolverTests`)
- [x] HC-021 `.hcs` reader → cascade-sheet model (selectors, rules, `@dimension[value]` blocks) — `Sources/Hypercode/HCS/CascadeSheet*.swift`
- [x] HC-022 Selector matching as `Specification`s over nodes: type / `.class` / `#id` / child (`>`) — `HCS/SelectorSpecs.swift`
- [x] HC-023 Specificity + cascade as a `DecisionSpec`: `(specificity, source-order)` → value + provenance — `HCS/Resolver.swift` *(origin/importance deferred until there's syntax for it)*
- [x] HC-024 Context activation: `@dimension[value]` guards (env / client) via `Rule.isActive(in:)`
- [x] HC-025 Resolver: `.hc` + `.hcs` + context → resolved graph with provenance — `HCS/Resolver.swift`
- [x] HC-026 Resolver tests: RFC §5 web-service example (dev + production + provenance), reader & selector tests — `Tests/`
- [x] HC-027 CLI: `hypercode resolve app.hc --hcs config.hcs [--ctx key=value]` — prints the resolved tree with provenance; `Examples/service.{hc,hcs}` — `Sources/HypercodeCLI/`

## M3 — Emit & validation
- [x] HC-030 Generic emit: resolved graph → canonical IR `hypercode.ir/v1` (JSON/YAML), schema-agnostic, hand-rolled — `Sources/Hypercode/Emit/`, CLI `emit`
- [x] HC-031 `hypercode validate`: id uniqueness (.hc) + dangling-selector warnings (.hcs vs .hc) — `Sources/Hypercode/Validation/`, CLI `validate`
- [x] HC-032 Versioned resolved-graph schema (cross-impl contract) + fixtures — `Schema/hypercode-ir-v1.schema.json` *(automated schema-validation in CI deferred)*

## M4 — Consumers & compilation (downstream)
- [x] HC-040 White-label example: one `.hc`, swap `--ctx client=…` → different brand builds — `Examples/whitelabel/` + `WhiteLabelTests`
- [x] HC-041 Backends/adapters pattern doc: resolved graph → target language/format — `DOCS/Backends.md`
- 🅿️ HC-042 Ontology path (in the **Ontology** repo): `ontologyc import-hypercode` maps resolved graph → DomainOntologyPackage YAML; `--schema` stays consumer-side *(blocked: awaiting decision on Ontology application areas)*

## M5 — Formal verification 🅿️
- [x] HC-050 Lean 4 cascade oracle — `SPEC/lean/HypercodeOracle.lean`: executable model, machine-checked agreement with the Swift service example (`native_decide`), kernel-checked order facts, and a `cascade_total` theorem *(generic order-independence proof = future)*

## M6 — Shared grammar-core (sequenced: Hypercode first, then refactor consumers)
- [x] HC-060 Canonical `.hc` grammar-core as layered Specifications — `Sources/Hypercode/Specifications/` (Lexical: `IdentifierSpec`; Syntactic: `CommandSpec`, line specs; Decisions: `LineKindDecision`). Indentation stays in the hand-rolled lexer front.
- [x] HC-061 Dialect analysis (core vs Hyperprompt quotes/references/paths) + extraction proposal — `DOCS/Dialects.md` *(core-vs-dialect surface decision flagged for you)*
- 🅿️ HC-062 Hyperprompt lives as an independent dialect (decision A: core stays minimal, Hyperprompt not refactored) *(closed by design — Hyperprompt's grammar is a different language, not a duplicate)*
- 🅿️ HC-063 Refactor Ontology's Hypercode import path onto the shared grammar-core *(blocked: awaiting Ontology application decision)*

## M7 — Diagnostics & LSP (VS Code)
- [x] HC-100 Structured diagnostics: unified `Diagnostic` (severity, code, source range), LSP-shaped JSON + editor-parseable text, CLI `--diagnostics text|json` — `Sources/Hypercode/Diagnostics/`
- [x] HC-101 Minimal Swift LSP server (`hypercode lsp`): JSON-RPC over stdio, `initialize`, document sync (didOpen/didChange/didSave/didClose), live `publishDiagnostics` — `Sources/HypercodeCLI/LSPServer.swift` + shared `diagnostics(for:text:)` in the library
- [x] HC-102 Thin VS Code extension on `vscode-languageclient` launching `hypercode lsp` — `editors/vscode/` (languages `.hc`/`.hcs`, `hypercode.serverPath` setting); compiled in CI (`.github/workflows/vscode-extension.yml`)
- [x] HC-103 Completion (type/class/id from AST, `.` and `#` triggers) + hover (Markdown: type/class/id/children) — `LSPServer.swift`

*(Aim straight for LSP — the standard for VS Code & editor-agnostic. Hyperprompt's custom CLI+JSON-RPC was a documented MVP stopgap; see its ADR-001.)*

## M8 — Spec-layer hardening (RFC §9 follow-through)

P0 — what makes the novelty claim defensible:
- ✅ HC-110 `hypercode explain <selector> [property] [--ctx …]` — full cascade trace: winner *and* losing rules with specificity/source-order; shipped in 0.5.0: [#21](https://github.com/0al-spec/Hypercode/pull/21)
- ✅ HC-111 Monotonic selector contracts — property schemas attached via selectors; values cascade, contracts accumulate by intersection & narrow; weakening = resolution error (normative: RFC §9.4 + `EBNF/Hypercode_Resolution.md` §7); shipped in 0.5.0: [#22](https://github.com/0al-spec/Hypercode/pull/22); value enforcement (HC2104): [#23](https://github.com/0al-spec/Hypercode/pull/23)
- ✅ HC-112 `hypercode.ir/v2` (breaking) — typed values (v1 is strings-only), `file` alongside `line`, specificity + source order, losing rules, contract results, per-node and per-document hashes, context echo, resolver name/version — `Schema/`; shipped in 0.5.0: [#19](https://github.com/0al-spec/Hypercode/pull/19) + [#20](https://github.com/0al-spec/Hypercode/pull/20)

P1 — built on v2:
- [x] HC-113 `hypercode diff <old.ir> <new.ir>` — affected nodes/properties with reasons (old/new winner rule), node-hash short-circuit (unchanged subtrees skipped), selector-identity node matching, added/removed/reordered detection, `--format json` = `hypercode.diff/v1` feed, exit 1 on change — `Sources/Hypercode/Diff/` (Foundation-free JSON parser with exact number lexemes)
- ⬜ HC-114 Runtime resolver boundary — document default build/generation-time mode vs. optional embedded runtime resolver (per-request context: caching, latency, provenance); decide library API or explicit out-of-scope — RFC §9.8
- 🅿️ HC-115 OpenFeature bridge for the runtime mode *(only if HC-114 decides "in scope")*
- [x] HC-116 `@import` for `.hcs` — sheet modularity: depth-first expansion at the directive position (importer wins ties), import-once for diamonds, cycle detection, cross-file provenance; contracts compose across imports — normative semantics `EBNF/Hypercode_Resolution.md` §5.1

## M9 — Validation & adoption (DOCS/Positioning.md)

- ⬜ HC-120 One deep Kustomize comparison demo — N tenants × M envs; metrics: duplicated structure, time-to-answer "why is this value here?", affected-module precision via IR diff; **must include** an own failure mode (specificity conflict) resolved via `explain`
- ⬜ HC-121 Dogfooding as the primary adoption path — Hyperprompt / Ontology consume the resolved IR (consumer-side dialects & backends per `DOCS/Dialects.md` / `DOCS/Backends.md`)
- 🅿️ HC-122 SLSA-like generation attestation chain — signed `.hc`/`.hcs` → IR hash → generator identity/version → artifact hashes → validator report (RFC §8, §9.8)
- 🅿️ HC-123 Agent Passport / 0AL integration — attestation chain plugs into 0AL's signed-agent model
- [x] HC-124 End-to-end AI codegen demo — `Examples/codegen-demo/`: service spec → IR v2 → Claude-generated module per node (embedded node hash + provenance comments) → `check.py` validates artifacts against the same contracts (HC2104-gen) and scopes regeneration by node hash; `generate.sh` regenerates stale modules via `claude -p`; checked in CI on every push

## Cross-cutting
- [x] HC-090 Swift CI workflow (build + test) — `.github/workflows/swift.yml`
- [x] HC-091 Repo layout documented (root Swift package) — `DOCS/Architecture.md`
- [x] HC-092 Usage guide with real CLI outputs (contexts, contracts as a CI gate, `explain`, IR v2, AI-codegen pipeline) — `DOCS/Usage.md`; `Examples/service.hcs` gained a `@contract:` block so the reference fixture exercises HC-111 *(PR #23)*
- [x] HC-092 ANTLR/Java relabeled as a conformance oracle — `DOCS/Architecture.md`
