# Hypercode
Declarative programming paradigm for context-aware systems

## RFC / Specification

- [RFC: Hypercode — A Declarative Paradigm for Context-Aware Programming](RFC/Hypercode.md) — Draft specification (concepts, syntax, HCS cascading model, examples). Read this to understand the language goals, selectors, contextual `@rules`, and execution model.

## Subprojects

- [EBNF / ANTLR Playground](EBNF/README.md) — A minimal interactive environment for experimenting with the Hypercode grammar (ANTLR4). Contains the lexer/parser grammars, example `.hc` files, build/run Makefile and tests. See `EBNF/README.md` for requirements and quick-start instructions.
